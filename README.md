# Customer Retail Cluster

This report shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks that I used to analyze the [Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset/data). The [dataset]() contains 3900 rows and 18 columns. I mainly focused on the customers' shopping habits and segmented them by Ages and Gender to target marketing. Also, I applied K-Means Clustering and PCA for segmenting the customers in different ways. 

Here are the different notebooks:
* [Data Exploration](): EDA of the raw datasets and data cleaning.
* [Customer Segmentation](): Segmenting the customers by Ages and Gender to target marketing.
* [K-Means Clustering](********): Segmenting the customers with K-Means Clustering and PCA for further analysis.
