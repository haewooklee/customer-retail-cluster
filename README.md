# Customer Retail Cluster

## Overview

This report shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks that I used to analyze the [Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset/data). The [dataset](https://github.com/haewooklee/customer-retail-cluster/blob/main/data/shopping_behavior_updated.csv) contains 3900 rows and 18 columns. I mainly focused on the customers' shopping habits such as Shipping Preferences by Demographics, Categories by Gender, and correlation analysis. I segmented customers using two approaches: by age and gender, and through K-Means Clustering for targeted marketing.

Here are the different notebooks:
* [Data Exploration](https://github.com/haewooklee/customer-retail-cluster/blob/main/notebook/3%20Data%20Explore.ipynb): Data cleaning and EDA.
* [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/haewooklee/customer-retail-cluster/blob/main/notebook/3%20Data%20segmentation.ipynb): Segmenting the customers by Ages and Gender to target marketing.
* [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/haewooklee/customer-retail-cluster/blob/main/notebook/3-Clustering%20and%20marketing.ipynb): Segmenting the customers with K-Means Clustering and PCA for further analysis.
